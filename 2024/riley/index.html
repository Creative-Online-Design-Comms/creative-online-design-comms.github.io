                <p>Gypsy’s life began in 1991, born in Louisiana from her mother, Dee Dee Blanchard. Her father, Rob Blanchard, had already separated from Dee Dee before Gypsy was born. From infancy, Dee Dee insisted Gypsy had many serious heath problems, including leukemia, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy. From family and friends, to doctors and charities, Dee Dee managed to convince everyone that her daughter was seriously ill. She was extremely controlling of Gypsy, she didn’t let her go to school, keeping Gypsy in a bubble away from society so she could feed her lies everyday. She didn’t allow Gypsy to talk to anyone without her supervision or to have any real friends.</p>

                <p>Dee Dee constantly lied to Gypsy about her health, forcing her to use a wheelchair at all times and only allowing her to eat via a feeding tube inserted into her body. She forced Gypsy to take a plethora of high-risk medications and undergo numerous dangerous and excruciating surgeries, all for nothing. These hazardous medications and surgeries began to take a toll on Gypsy’s health, making her get actually sick, which aided in the facade Dee Dee was maintaining. For example, Dee Dee tricked doctors into removing Gypsy’s salivary glands, causing her teeth to rot away.</p>

                <p>The exact motivation behind Dee Dee’s physical and psychological torture of her daughter is unknown. However, Dee Dee was benefiting significantly financially from her daughters misery. Her elaborate scam allowed her to collect large sums of money from the government, charities, neighbors, friends, family and her ex-husband. The Habitat for Humanity charity even built and gifted Dee Dee a house featuring a wheelchair ramp and jacuzzi.</p>

                <p>Gypsy grew suspicious of her mother in 2010. Up until this point she believed the lies her mother fed her, but now she was starting to have her doubts. She suspected Dee Dee was making her seem more ill than she actually was. Part of Dee Dee’s control involved not allowing Gypsy to use the internet freely. However, eventually she began using the computer in secret while her mother slept. In 2011 Gypsy attempted to escape, but her mother tracked her down and captured her.</p>

                <h2>Murder</h2>

                </figcaption>
                
                <p>In 2012 Gypsy met a guy named Nicholas Godejohn on a dating website. They talked online for a year before she revealed to him what her mother was doing to her. Nicholas urged her to contact the police, but Gypsy feared that would only make matters worse. She was under the impression that her mother had already talked with the police and manipulated them into believing that she was mentally incompetent.</p>

                <p>In March 2015 Gypsy and Nicholas set up an elaborate plan, involving them both meeting in real life for the first time. Gypsy knew that it wouldn’t be good if her mother found out that she’d been talking to this guy online for all these years. She knew her mother would be furious about that and forbid them from ever talking to each other again. So, she was going to trick her mother.</p>

                <p>The plan was to trick Dee Dee into thinking that Nicholas and Gypsy didn’t already know each other. The idea was to make it seem like Nicholas just happened to meet them together organically at the movie theater. Nicholas was hoping to leave a good impression on Dee Dee so that she would let him date her daughter freely. However, Gypsy and Nicholas were very naive to think that this would work out. Of course Gypsy’s controlling mother, who abuses her on a daily basis, was not going to let her date anyone.</p>

                <p>Nicholas traveled all the way from Wisconsin and managed to meet them in the theater. But, that’s when their plan fell apart. From the moment he spoke, Dee Dee seemed to immediately despise him. Dee Dee looked like she was infuriated that he was even there. After the movie, Dee Dee forbid Gypsy from ever seeing Nicholas again.</p>

                <p>Gypsy was trapped. She couldn’t call the police, because they wouldn’t believe her. She couldn’t run away, because Dee Dee would find her. Gypsy only had two options left. Either live like this forever, being physically and psychologically abused everyday. Forced to endure countless unnecessary painful surgeries. Forced to take to an array of dangerous, harmful medications on a regular basis, destroying her body. Forbidden to have friends, forbidden to find love, forbidden to have a life. Or, she could get rid of her mother, once and for all.</p>

                <p>In June 2015 Nicholas checked into a motel close to Dee Dee’s house. He waited until Gypsy gave him the all clear that Dee Dee was asleep, then he headed over. Upon arrival, Gypsy presented him with a knife, gloves and duct tape. Nicholas walked into Dee Dee’s room, then he stabbed her 17 times. After this, Gypsy and Nicholas headed to the motel and spent the night there. The next day, they mailed the knife to Nicholas’ home in Wisconsin, in order to avoid being caught with it. They then took a bus to Wisconsin together.</p>

                <p>Once Nicholas had brought Gypsy to his home, she began to worry about her mother’s body being left to rot, since no one else knew her dead body was in there. So she instructed Nicholas to create posts on Dee Dee’s Facebook page that would alert people to her demise. This was a terrible idea. Following the disturbing posts, friends and family of Dee Dee reached out to the police. The police searched the house and found her body.</p>

                <p>Police traced the IP from the posts and arrived at Nicholas’ home. At first the police figured the murderer kidnapped Gypsy, but upon arrival they were surprised to see her walking around without needing a wheelchair. Gypsy and Nicholas were both arrested. Gypsy received 10 years for second degree murder, while Nicholas received a life sentence without parole.</p>

                <h2>New Life</h2>

                <p>While imprisoned in 2017, Gypsy received a supportive letter from a man named Ken Urker. Gypsy wrote back and the pair quickly became friends. Ken visited her in prison and they started dating. In 2018 Ken proposed to Gypsy, but later canceled the engagement and broke up with her in 2019.</p>

                <p>In 2020, while still imprisoned, Gypsy received a letter from yet another supportive man. This one is called Ryan Scott Anderson. The two started exchanging letters regularly, meeting in person for the first time in 2021. Over time their relationship became more serious and in 2022 the couple got married in a prison ceremony.</p>

                <p>In anticipation of her release, Gypsy became a popular topic on social media. In December 2023 Gypsy was granted parole after serving 8 years of her sentence. After release she was quick to start posting, gaining her over 8 million followers on Instagram and 10 million on TikTok in just a few weeks. Gypsy faced a very mixed reaction online. Many people supported her at first, however over time this support waned considerably. Most of them forget about Gypsy and moved onto a new trending topic. However, many users switched up and began hating on her instead.</p>

                <p>In March 2024 Gypsy deactivated her Instagram account and deleted her TikTok account due to the overwhelming amount of hate she was receiving. In April Gypsy started a new Instagram account, this time set to private, however she accepts all follow requests and has gained over 700k on this account so far. A few days later, Gypsy got a nose job. It worked out really well, her nose became significantly smaller, especially noticeable from the side. Now with her new nose ready, only a few days later Gypsy filed for divorce against her husband, Ryan, for a multitude of reasons. Some reasons include his argumentative nature, controlling behavior, verbal abuse, jealousy and “food hoarding” tendencies.</p>

                <p>In the same month of leaving Ryan, Gypsy and Ken got back together. This was largely due to orchestration from Gypsy’s stepmother, Kristy Blanchard, who likes Ken a lot. Still in April, Gypsy also became pregnant with Ken’s baby, however she doesn’t reveal this to the public for a few more months. Gypsy ended up reactivating her deleted TikTok account in May and is actively posting on there again. Her original Instagram account is still deactivated, but it could potentially make a come back as it can easily be reactivated, when she’s ready.</p>

                <p>Gypsy announced her pregnancy in July and posted a gender reveal in August, revealing her baby to be a girl. As of September Gypsy has been continuing to post pregnancy updates on social media frequently, including to her YouTube channel. She receives mostly hate comments on her videos but she ignores them and continues to post anyway.</p>
