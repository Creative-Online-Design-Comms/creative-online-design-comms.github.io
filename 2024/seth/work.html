                        <p><b>"Seth Fleming" Project</b><br><br>
                            This is my project where I release solo music under my name. This project was born after wanting to put my guitar skills into
                            a small EP. This album was also made dedicated to my boyfriend, as we've always said we have a 'Sun and Moon' relationship dynamic
                            and all the song names being his online usernames over the time we have been dating.<br>
                            Sun & Moon is a solo guitar album that is mainly improvised. I went for this approach because it feels like it came from my mind and heart at that very moment of recording,
                            and there's a very low chance of writing the exact same thing again.</p>

                        <p><b>"Emperor Goblin" Project</b><br><br>
                            This project is much more experimental than my previous work. Emperor Goblin was made after messing around in Garageband, my first experience working inside a DAW.
                            After making "bad" music on purpose to call it "experimental", I created this sound I really enjoyed, and during my time making music for this project, I would include
                            multigenre elements into my albums, including metal, breakcore and fusion.<br>
                            Emperor Goblin was also an attempt at making a character & universe inside the project, Similar to Gorillaz and Ninja Sex Party.</p>
