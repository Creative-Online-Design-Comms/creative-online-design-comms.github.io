							My name is Amelia Cook and I am striving to become a young
							architect. I created this website to hold pieces that I have
							created of famous buildings. These are some buildings I have come
							across in research I have used in previous assessments. These
							pieces show my dedication and love for architecture in so many
							ways and this website has allowed me to learn more skills which I
							will be able to take into my future career.

				<div class="text-block">
					<!-- p for paragraphs-->
					<p>
						This website is created in the style of a portfolio to hold the work
						I have created based on famous buildings across the world. I have
						never created a website before so I hope the information you may be
						looking for is easy to find. This website contains different pages
						some containing information of the architects behind the sketches I
						have replicated and other pages contain my work and information on
						where to find me.
