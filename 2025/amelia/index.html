							My name is Amelia Cook and I am striving to become a young architect.
							I created this website to hold pieces that I have created of famous
							buildings. These are some buildings I have come across in research I 
						    have used in previous assessments. These pieces show my dedication
							and love for architecture in so many ways and this website has allowed
							me to learn more skills which I will be able to take into my future career.

				<h2>About Website</h2>

				<div class="text-block">
						<!-- p for paragraphs-->
						<p>
							This website is created in the style of a portfolio to hold the work I have created
							based on famous buildings across the world. I have never created a website before
							so I hope the information you may be looking for is easy to find. This website contains
							different pages some containing information of the architects behind the sketches
							I have replicated and other pages contain my work and information on where to find me.
