				<p>
					My first sketch is of the Clayton house which I had done in 2022. I
					based this sketch off of a book called Archi doodle. I love sketching
					houses and the clayton house stood out to me not because of its
					history but because of the way you could imagine so many different
					materials when looking at the building in pencil or black and white.
					Looking at it in black and white it could be made to look modern or
					traditional, and there are so many different materials you could use
					on this that would link together quite nicely. Its not until you see
					this home for what it is that you realise how traditional this home
					actually is.

				<p>
					This sketch is of the fallingwater house which is a famous building
					found in america. The building was designed in 1939 by Frank Lloyd
					Wright and was one of the first homes to blend in with its
					environment. I love this house not for the way it looks but the way it
					shows a change in architecture, a movement from traditional
					architecture to a modern timeline. A way of working with the land
					around the building to suit it forever. In my career path I wish to
					work with both land and sustainability and this home is one of the
					first homes that could possibly hint at both of these. I also
					completed this sketch in 2022.

				<p>
					The next building is the Heydar Aliyev building which is surprisingly
					difficult to draw, this building was designed by Zaha Hadid just 3
					years before she passed. This building is located in Baku city,
					Azerbaijan and acts as a Cultural Hub for many things such as a
					concert hall, library, national museum and more. I wanted to draw this
					building as it defied what people thought about architecture. It took
					modernism to a whole new level and I love how the flowing architecture
					runs across the entire building inside and out. The spacial feeling of
					this building should remind you how small we are compared to the world
					around us.

				</figure>

				<p>
					My favourite building to sketch was the Lotus temple, I love this
					building as it makes architecture a part of nature rather than
					attempting to blend with it. The point of view you would need as an
					architect to produce something like this is so vastly different but
					that is what makes it so incredible. I have 3D printed this structure
					so I knew I had to create it as a sketch for this project and I love
					how it turned out. The lotus temple is found in New Delhi India and is
					considered a place of Worship. Many great architects across the world
					have visited this building and said great things. This buidling will
					be an architectural staple of the 20th Century. Forever in Bloom.

				<p>
					The Farnsworth house is another building I drew for this project and
					its simplicity means little to many eyes across the world, however,
					this house represented the minimalism era as we know it today. This
					home was designed in 1950 by Ludwig Mies Van der Rohe, and it showed
					how we took minimalism in art and carried it into architecture. People
					before 1950 had never thought of owning a home that looked like this.
					However, for the farsworths this was all they needed. I didn't draw
					this building because of how easy it was or how it looked I drew this
					home because of what it means to architects across the world and how
					it influences our work.

				<p>
					The last buidling I drew was the Guggenheim Museum. The Guggenheim
					Museum was also designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and has been a staple
					point for both art and architecture. I have never drawn anything like
					the Guggenheim before so this was quite difficult for me to achieve.
					The Guggenheim is located in New York and was built in 1956. The
					famous builing competes with the art inside and stands out across the
					typical architecture found in New York. I love The way it fills the
					space in such a unique way. The building was originally intended for a
					man named Solomon Guggenheim to hold his art after Solomon Passed the
					Guggenheim has since been used to hold art from all across the world.
					Frank promised that his creation would "mke the building and painting
					an uninterrupted, beautiful symphony such as never existed in the
					World of Art before" and he did just that.
