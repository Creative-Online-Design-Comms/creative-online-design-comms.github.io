				<p>	
					My first sketch is of the Clayton house which I had done in 2022. I based this sketch off
					of a book called Archi doodle. I love sketching houses and the clayton house stood out to me
					not because of its history but because of the way you could imagine so many different
					materials when looking at the building in pencil or black and white. Looking at it in black
					and white it could be made to look modern or traditional, and there are so many different
					materials you could use on this that would link together quite nicely. Its not until you see
					this home for what it is that you realise how traditional this home actually is.

				<p>	
					This sketch is of the fallingwater house which is a famous building found in america. The
							building was designed in 1939 by Frank Lloyd Wright and was one of the first homes to blend
							in with its environment. I love this house not for the way it looks but the way it shows a
							change in architecture, a movement from traditional architecture to a modern timeline. A 
							way of working with the land around the building to suit it forever. In my career path I 
							wish to work with both land and sustainability and this home is one of the first homes that
							could possibly hint at both of these. I also completed this sketch in 2022.

				<p>	
					The next building is the Heydar Aliyev building which is surprisingly difficult to draw, this
							building was designed by Zaha Hadid just 3 years before she passed. This building is located
							in Baku city, Azerbaijan and acts as a Cultural Hub for many things such as a concert hall, 
							library, national museum and more. I wanted to draw this building as it defied what people
							thought about architecture. It took modernism to a whole new level and I love how the flowing
							architecture runs across the entire building inside and out. The spacial feeling of this
							building should remind you how small we are compared to the world around us.

				<p>	
					My favourite building to sketch was the Lotus temple, I love this building as it makes
							architecture a part of nature rather than attempting to blend with it. The point of view you
							would need as an architect to produce something like this is so vastly different but that is
							what makes it so incredible. I have 3D printed this structure so I knew I had to create it as
							a sketch for this project and I love how it turned out. The lotus temple is found in New
							Delhi India and is considered a place of Worship. Many great architects across the world have
							visited this building and said great things. This buidling will be an architectural staple of
							the 20th Century. Forever in Bloom.

				<p>	
					The Farnsworth house is another building I drew for this project and its simplicity means little
							to many eyes across the world, however, this house represented the minimalism era as we know it
							today. This home was designed in 1950 by Ludwig Mies Van der Rohe, and it showed how we took
							minimalism in art and carried it into architecture. People before 1950 had never thought of
							owning a home that looked like this. However, for the farsworths this was all they needed. I
							didn't draw this building because of how easy it was or how it looked I drew this home because
							of what it means to architects across the world and how it influences our work.

					The last buidling I drew was the Guggenheim Museum. The Guggenheim Museum was also designed by
							Frank Lloyd Wright and has been a staple point for both art and architecture. I have never drawn
							anything like the Guggenheim before so this was quite difficult for me to achieve. The Guggenheim
							is located in New York and was built in 1956. The famous builing competes with the art inside and
							stands out across the typical architecture found in New York. I love The way it fills the space
							in such a unique way. The building was originally intended for a man named Solomon Guggenheim to
							hold his art after Solomon Passed the Guggenheim has since been used to hold art from all across
							the world. Frank promised that his creation would "mke the building and painting an uninterrupted,
							beautiful symphony such as never existed in the World of Art before" and he did just that.
