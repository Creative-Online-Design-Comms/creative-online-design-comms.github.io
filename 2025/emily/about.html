							Hi! I’m Emily Wister, the creator of Wisteria Whimsy 
							and the sole designer behind every piece of jewellery you see here.  
							Thanks to a family that loved nature and encouraged artistic expression 
							I was raised in an environment that fostered my skills that I use to this day. 
							That early connection to beauty and creativity has stayed with me ever since. 
							I moved to New Zealand in 2020, and it was here that I began taking jewellery-making 
							seriously. I’ve been creating handmade jewellery for about six years now being entirely
							 self-taught through lots of trial and error  and a lot of passion.
						</p>

						While I’ve come a long way, I’m still learning every day, 
						evolving my artistic expression and that’s part of what I love most 
						about this craft. My specialties are wire-wrapping and seed beading,
						 and I’m drawn to the intricate, delicate nature of hand-crafted design. For me, jewellery is more than just accessories but a way to express my creativity, love of all things beautiful, and share happiness with others. 
						 I create each piece with care, not just for the love of the art, but because 
						 I know how much happiness a hand-crafted piece can bring to someone else. That
						  connection is what inspires me most. 
<br>
Thank you for being here and supporting my handmade jewellery. I hope you find something that speaks to you.
