						Te Awa Tupua – the Whanganui River – is the longest navigable river in New Zealand. In its beauty and its unique scenery, it has become a major tourist attraction with leisurely river boat cruises and jet boats a regular feature alongside canoes, kayaks, river safaris and mountain biking.<br>
                        From our earliest times, Te Awa Tupua has acted as a central artery for our numerous kāinga and pā sites, urupā and other wāhi tapu throughout the length of the river; our tribal homes, our cemeteries and our sacred spaces. The river formed the natural line of communication with the interior. In this one interconnected artery, tribal alliances were vital. It is likened to the rope that binds all the whānau together from the mountain to the sea, connecting our people with the rivers, mountains, lakes, forests and seas.

							<h4>Fun Fact</h4>
							<p>In March 2017, the New Zealand parliament enacted the Te Awa Tupua Act which declared the Whanganui River a legal person with fundamental rights. This means the Te Awa Tupua will have its own legal identity with all the corresponding rights, duties and liabilities of a legal person.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="fact img-right">
						<div class="fact-text">
							<h4>Fun Fact</h4>
							<p>This legislation made the Whanganui river the second in the world to gain recognized legal rights, following Colombia’s Constitutional Court Judgment on the Atrato River Case in November 2016. Just five days after the Te Awa Tupua Act was enacted, the Uttarakhand High Court in India recognized two rivers (the Ganga and Yamuna) as “living entities” with fundamental rights, also allowing designated humans to represent the rivers in court and file complaints on the rivers’ behalf. The legislation is still in effect.</p>

							<h4>Fun Fact</h4>
							<p>Whanganui is a phrase meaning "big bay"[17] or "big harbour". Some very early maps show that European settlers called the river the Knowsley River,[18] however it was known as the Wanganui River until its name was officially changed to Whanganui in 1991,[19] respecting the wishes of local iwi. Part of the reason for this change was also to avoid confusion with the Wanganui River in the South Island. The city at the river's mouth was called Wanganui until December 2009, when the government decided that while either spelling was acceptable, Crown agencies would use the Whanganui spelling.[20]</p>

							<h3>How Taranaki carved the awa</h3>
							<!-- p for paragraphs-->
							<p>
								When the great mountains Tongariro and Taranaki came into conflict over the love of the beautiful Mt Pihanga, a mighty battle ensued. Tongiriro eventually won this fierce battle and Taranaki, wild with grief and anger at the loss of his love, ripped himself from the ground and tore a path through the country to the setting sun.
								Soon after the mighty battle, a stream of clear water sprang from Tongariro, which filled and healed the wound Taranaki had made in his flight towards the ocean. Green forests, filled with the songs of birds, grew throughout the valley of this new river, known as the Whanganui River.

							<h3>How Ranginui created the awa</h3>
							<!-- p for paragraphs-->
							<p>
								There are different tribal accounts of the origins of the Whanganui River, but they all begin with the mountains of the central North Island. One story is that Ruapehu, pictured here, suffered from loneliness. Ranginui, the sky-father, laid two tear drops at his feet, one of which became the Whanganui River. But Ruapehu’s loneliness remained, so Ranginui sent four mountain companions: Tongariro (to guard the tear drops), Ngāuruhoe, Taranaki, and Pīhanga, the mountain maiden. Pīhanga was promised as Tongariro’s wife, but she was tempted by the charms of Taranaki. On Ruapehu’s advice, Taranaki sadly left the mountain enclave. He followed the route of the Whanganui River to the coast before heading west, from where he gazes back towards his former companions.

						<p>With a length of 290 kilometres (180 mi), the Whanganui is the country's third-longest river. Much of the land to either side of the upper reaches is part of the Whanganui National Park, though the river itself is not part of the park.
							The river rises on the northern slopes of Mount Tongariro, one of the three active volcanoes of the central plateau, close to Lake Rotoaira. It flows to the north-west before turning south-west at Taumarunui. From here it runs through the rough, bush-clad hill country of the King Country before turning south-east and flowing past the small settlements of Pipiriki and Jerusalem, before reaching the coast at the city of Whanganui.
							
							For most of its course, the Whanganui River course is deeply entrenched in sandstone and mudstone, and the runoff makes it very muddy.
							The river’s most spectacular scenery is in its middle reaches, between Whakahoro and Pipiriki, where it passes through a series of narrow gorges amidst one of the North Island’s largest areas of unmodified lowland forest, much of it part of Whanganui National Park. The river has 239 named rapids, but a gentle gradient. Lacking falls, it is navigable upstream as far as Taumarunui.
							</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<p>The river valley changed in the 1843 Wanganui earthquake.
							In 1975, a minor eruption from Mount Ruapehu spilled some of the contents from the Ruapehu Crater Lake (the same root cause of the Tangiwai disaster). This toxic water entered the Whanganui River and had the effect of killing much of the fish life downstream. In the aftermath of the poisoning, eels as large as 8.2 kilograms (18 lb) and trout as large as 2.3 kilograms (5.1 lb) were washed up dead along the banks of the river.[7] The tributary Whakapapa River had fish losses due to a lahar from Ruapehu in April 1975.[8] Possibly this had effects downstream.
							
							The river is the home of the Whanganui iwi (tribes), also known as Te Āti Haunui-a-Pāpārangi, a confederation of three ancestral groups: Hinengākau of the upper river, Tama Ūpoko of the middle reaches and Tūpoho of the lower Whanganui.
							The river is of huge importance to the iwi: it is their ancestral river, their arterial highway, and a source of physical and spiritual sustenance. Although few Whanganui Māori now live on the river, it remains a focal point.

						<p>The river is of special and spiritual importance for Māori, who also refer to it as Te awa tupua. It was the home for a large proportion of Māori villages in pre-European times. As such, it is regarded as taonga, a special treasure. Local iwi first petitioned Parliament in the 1870s,[9] and efforts have since been made to safeguard the river and give it the respect it deserves.
							For the same reason, the river has been one of the most fiercely contested regions of the country in claims before the Waitangi Tribunal for the return of tribal lands. The Whanganui River claim is heralded as the longest-running legal case in New Zealand history[10] with petitions and court action in the 1930s, Waitangi Tribunal hearings in the 1990s, the ongoing Tieke Marae land occupation since 1993, and the highly publicised Moutoa Gardens occupation in 1995.[11]

						<p>On 30 August 2012 agreement was reached that entitled the Whanganui River to a legal identity,[12][13] a first in the world,[9] and on 15 March 2017 the relevant settlement was passed into law (Te Awa Tupua (Whanganui River Claims Settlement) Act 2017) by the New Zealand Parliament.[14] Chris Finlayson, the Minister for Treaty of Waitangi Negotiations, said the river would have an identity "with all the corresponding rights, duties and liabilities of a legal person". He said some people would consider it strange, but it is "no stranger than family trusts, or companies, or incorporated societies."[15][16] The bill finalised 140-year-old negotiations between Māori and the government.[5] The river will be represented by two officials, one from Māori and the other from the government.[4]</p>

						<p>In 1892 Alexander Hatrick was contracted by Thomas Cook & Son to carry tourists to Pipiriki[28] on the paddle-steamer PS Waimarie, the journey was "The Rhine of Maoriland" tourist route into the interior of New Zealand. The river boat subsequently carried mail, passengers and cargo.
							PS Waimarie operates on the lower stretches of the river, including dinner cruises to Avoca Hotel at Upokongaro and trips to Hipango Park for overnight camping.[29]
							On 18 June 2010 the Adventurer 2 river boat embarked,[30] attempting to make the 230-kilometre (140 mi) voyage to Taumarunui. The first voyage to Taumarunui in 82 years. The Adventurer 2 now offers this trip to tourist as an historic alternative to jet boating and canoeing the river.[31] Though in low water flows it cannot make it all the way to Taumarunui.

						<p>The Whanganui River was the supply artery for the early communities along its banks. River boats used to ply the river, and also into the Ōhura River and Ongarue Rivers unless these routes were log jammed after floods.
							Between 1891 and 1958 the Alexander Hatrick Riverboat service operated on the Whanganui River. The paddle-steamer Wairere ordered from London and shipped in sections then assembled in Whanganui in late 1891.
							It is said that Taumarunui was the highest reach of the Whanganui River that was navigable by river boat. The river flow was managed by the "Wanganui River Trust Board" which built containing walls to direct and deepen the rivers channels for river traffic. Even so, river boats sometimes found it necessary to winch themselves up the more difficult rapids. The River Trust existed from 1891 to 1940.[32]</p>
